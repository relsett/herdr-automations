# Changelog

What changed for someone using the plugin. Dates are release dates.

## Unreleased

- `workspace: existing` with `workspace_id` opens each run in a fresh tab inside
  one existing workspace. Several automations can share a space without creating
  a new workspace or Git worktree per run. Completed tabs can stay open without
  their agent names blocking later runs.
- `model:` on a `pi` automation no longer fails to load. Pi takes `--model`, and
  its pattern accepts `provider/id`, so `model: xai/grok-4.6` pins the route too.

## v0.7.0 — 2026-09-01

- A run that fails, a run that's missed, or a broken `automations.yaml` entry
  now raises a Herdr toast — in-session only, a panel inside the Herdr window,
  not an OS notification. A successful or skipped run stays quiet on purpose.
  Missed and broken entries are grouped into one toast per scheduler tick, so a
  laptop waking from a weekend gets one panel, not twenty.
- An agent that crashes mid-run is now recorded (and toasted) as `failed`
  instead of `cancelled`. Previously the board could not tell a crash apart
  from you closing the workspace on purpose.
- `model:` on `grok`, `qwen`, `kimi`, `amp`, `droid`, `copilot`, and `hermes`
  automations no longer fails to load — the allowlist behind it was stale.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-08-31

- `herdr-automations pause <name>` / `resume <name>` stop and restart an
  automation without hand-editing `automations.yaml`. The board's `p` key does
  the same for the row under your cursor. Both just toggle the `disabled` flag
  that already existed in the file, so anything that already reads it (`list`,
  the board) shows the change immediately.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-08-25

- One bad entry in `automations.yaml` no longer stops the others. A typo in the
  seventh automation used to fail the whole file, and the daemon's answer was a
  line in a log nobody reads at 09:00 — every automation silently stopped
  firing. Each entry now stands on its own: the broken one is reported with the
  line to fix and skipped, the rest run. `herdr-automations list` names them
  under the table, the board gives each one a red row you can press `e` on, and
  `run <name>` says why it did not load instead of claiming no such automation
  exists.
- `herdr-automations add` refuses while an entry in the file is broken, rather
  than rewriting the file without it. Fix the entry first — the message says
  which line.
- The plugin no longer loses track of its own config directory when herdr is
  reinstalled under it. v0.4.2 fixed this for the board and `cleanup`; the same
  stale-path bug survived in the code that locates `automations.yaml`, where the
  symptom was worse — an empty config, so every automation appeared to vanish.
- `cleanup` stops at the first worktree git refuses to remove instead of
  skipping past it, and says which one. A refusal means something about the
  worktree was not what the plan thought.
- The board and the CLI now describe run worktrees in the same words. They had
  drifted: "3 run worktrees, 1 still open" against "no run worktree is finished
  with".

## v0.4.2 — 2026-08-21

- Closing a run's workspace now ends the run. It is the natural way to call one
  off, but the runner sat waiting for the agent until the automation's whole
  timeout expired — a 45-minute run cancelled thirteen seconds in was reported
  three quarters of an hour later, and blocked the next occurrence of the same
  automation in the meantime. The run is now recorded as `cancelled`, not
  `failed`: nothing broke, somebody decided.
- The plugin survives herdr being reinstalled under it. Herdr tells plugins
  which binary to call back into, and a herdr running since before its own
  binary moved — a package manager switch, an uninstall — keeps naming a path
  that no longer exists. `cleanup` and the board died on it with a fork/exec
  error. They now fall back to `herdr` on PATH.

## v0.4.1 — 2026-08-21

- A run that comes due while the machine is asleep no longer dies on waking.
  Creating its worktree can return a second before the pane's shell is at a
  prompt, and the agent was started into it immediately: herdr refused, and the
  run was recorded as failed having done nothing at all. The runner now waits
  for the shell, for up to two minutes. Every other start failure still fails
  the run immediately — a misspelled agent kind will not fix itself.
- A failed run says why it failed. When the herdr CLI exited without printing
  anything, the history recorded a bare `worktree create:` — enough to know the
  run had failed and nothing more. It now reports the exit status, the signal
  that killed it, or that the binary was not found.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-08-20

- `herdr-automations cleanup` removes the worktrees left by runs whose work
  already landed — merged branches, and runs that produced no commit. Runs with
  a workspace still open, or with commits that exist nowhere else, are kept and
  told why. It asks before removing anything and never runs on a schedule.
- A `workflow:` automation now reports what actually happened. It used to record
  `done` as soon as the command was typed into the pane — including when
  herdr-workflows was not installed at all. The runner now refuses to start when
  `hwf` is missing, waits for the workflow to finish, and fails the run on a
  non-zero exit.
- The board cleans up too: `c` scans, says how many worktrees are finished with,
  and waits for `y/n` before removing anything.
- `list` says how many run worktrees exist and how many still have a workspace
  open: the ones nobody has read.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-19

- `model:` per automation, passed to the agent as `--model`. An agent kind whose
  executable has no such flag is rejected when the file loads, not at 3am.
- `list` shows the model of every automation, and says `agent default` where none
  was set, so an unattended run on an unintended model is visible.
- Schedules that come due at the same minute are reported: the wizard warns while
  the cron is still being chosen, `list` reports the week ahead. Nothing is
  serialised — Herdr runs them all, as the cron says.
- The wizard asks for a model every time.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-08-17

- A run no longer fails when the agent was slow to accept the prompt: the runner
  checks whether the agent actually started working before giving up. Agents
  loading MCP servers on a freshly woken machine were the common case.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-17

- Occurrences are computed off the wall clock. A run due while the laptop slept
  now fires on wake within `catch_up_minutes` instead of vanishing; anything
  later is recorded as `missed` rather than silently dropped.
- `install-skill` symlinks the bundled skill into `~/.claude/skills`, which is
  the only place agents look.
- Agent names are slugified like branch names, so an automation whose name has
  spaces or punctuation no longer fails to start.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-08-16

- Prebuilt, checksum-verified binaries for macOS and Linux (arm64/amd64):
  installing no longer needs a Go toolchain.
