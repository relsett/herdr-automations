// Package host is the seam between a run and the machine it happens on.
//
// Two methods: provision somewhere for the work to happen, then do the work.
// Behind them sits everything that used to be the runner's problem — which
// herdr error code means "retry", which means "the agent is gone", how long a
// fresh pane gets to become a shell, how a delegated command's exit status is
// recovered from a terminal that has no exit status.
//
// The point of the narrowness is that runner.Run becomes testable. Four of the
// ten releases before this seam existed fixed sequencing bugs in that function
// and not one of the fixes could be pinned by a test, because there was no
// interface between it and exec.Command.
